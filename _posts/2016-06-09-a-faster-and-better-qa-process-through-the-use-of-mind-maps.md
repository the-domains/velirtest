  It's a common misconception that you don't need to bring QA in until the end
  of your project. Once development is near completion, QA comes in, writes test
  cases, and begins their frenzy of testing. Yes, that can work, but there's a
  better way to do things.The truth is, the earlier you catch a bug, the less
  expensive it's going to be to fix.
