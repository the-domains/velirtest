      There have been tons and tons of implementations around the world of my
      wonderfully profitable See-Think-Do-Care business framework. This is

      companies to drive new and rapid innovation in their digital strategies
      using the framework.

  entails. Personalization is often spoken about in generalities, as if it's a
  basic requirement.
